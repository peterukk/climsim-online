# This input file tests Skywalker's Fortran 90 module with an ensemble that
# includes enumerated parameters.

settings:
  setting1: hello
  setting2: 81
  setting3: 3.14159265357

# All enumerated parameters must be sequences of the same size, which is the
# number of members in the ensemble (in this case, 11).
input:
  fixed:
    p1: 1
    p2: 2
    p3: 3
  enumerated:
    tick:        [0, 10, 1] # linear spacing from 0 to 10 in steps of 1.
    log10(tock): [1, 11, 1] # logarithmic spacing from 10 to 1e11 in powers of 10
    log10(neg_tock): [-11, -1, 1] # log spacing with negative numbers!
