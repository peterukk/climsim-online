# Overview

MAM4xx is a performance-portable, GPU-capable C++ implementation of the 4-mode
version of the Modal Aerosol Model (MAM), intended for use with E3SM.

* The [Installation](installation.md) guide shows you how to build and install
  MAM4xx on your own machine or on a supported high-performance platform.
* The [Developer](development.md) guide lays out some basic principles and
  guidelines we use in developing MAM4xx.
* In the [Testing](testing.md) guide, we describe in general terms the
  methodology we use to test MAM4xx and its aerosol processes.

MAM4xx was developed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of aerosol and
atmospheric researchers, applied mathematicians, and software engineers. It was
created for the [EAGLES project](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/enabling-aerosol-cloud-interactions-global-convection-permitting-scales-eagles),
an effort to improve the treatment of aerosols in
[E3SM](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model),
the Department of Energy's global climate model. The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/eagles-project/mam4xx). This effort was funded by
the Office of Science's [Biological and Environmental
Research](https://science.osti.gov/ber) Program.
