# Test case descriptions

This folder contains documentation for our test cases.
So far, this documentation resides in scripts that may require other software (e.g., Mathematica)
to access.  As the work matures, we will write up summaries for each aerosol test case in
a .tex file and include it in our design docs.

In the meantime, this folder serves as a reference point and collaborative foundation.
